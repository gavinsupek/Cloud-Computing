The Cloud

      The cloud is basically a flowing network of resources such as servers, storage and other computing stuff such as hardware and software. It provides a multitude of services across the internet. It is essential because it benefits people as well as business and organizations such as the government. Its scalability makes it flexible to allow users to modify their resources to do what they need for them. It also is more cost effective as well as the availability and the reliability makes it overall the way to go in the modern age. 
	In traditional computing it is more on the hardware thatâ€™s right there locally to store data and using the software to process data. With the cloud the resources and data are put onto remote servers that you can get to and access over the internet. This also gets rid of the physical need to work on them because the providers take over the maintenance. It is also cheaper than traditional in the sense that you pay for the services instead of having to get the resources yourself. The main thing is the access from all over the internet instead of having to be stuck in one place and only being able to access it from that machine.
