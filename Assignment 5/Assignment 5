Why the Cloud



A lot of companies can work use the cloud for work. A big one that I can think of would be like data services such as background check companies. It would be good to use so they can just get the data all online and be able to not use such office space and cut down on costs and being able to access the data from anywhere. The cloud would be an excellent choice they would just have to have very good cloud security because of the privacy of such data they are dealing with. This would also provide more jobs within the company to contain all the devices using the cloud and the support they need for the end users. The initial cost of getting of the end users the devices to use would be a pretty penny but overall in the end it would reduce cost as well as improve performance of the company once everyone gets trained.
